## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trippy-effects-app.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd trippy-effects-app
```

### Install Dependencies

The application relies on the **PDF.js** library, which is included via CDN in the `index.html`. No additional installations are required. However, ensure you have a local server to run the app.

### Run the Application

You can use any local server setup. Here's how to do it using **Live Server** in VSCode:

1. **Install the Live Server Extension:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
   - Search for **"Live Server"** and install it.

2. **Open the Project Folder:**
   - Open the `trippy-effects-app` folder in VSCode.

3. **Start Live Server:**
   - Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer panel.
   - Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
   - Your default browser should open `http://localhost:5500` (port may vary).

Alternatively, using Python's SimpleHTTPServer:

#### For Python 3.x:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

#### For Python 2.x:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

### Uploading Media

1. Click on the **"Choose File"** button in the header.
2. Select a media file from your device. Supported formats include:
   - **Images:** JPEG, JPG, GIF
   - **Videos:** MP4, WebM, etc.
   - **Audio:** MP3, WAV, etc.
   - **PDFs:** Any standard PDF document.

#### Processing:

- The app will process the uploaded file and render it onto the canvas.
- For PDFs, only the first page is rendered.

### Applying Effects

#### Glitch Effect:

1. Click the **"Toggle Glitch"** button to apply or remove the Glitch effect.
2. Adjust the **Glitch Intensity** slider to control the severity of the glitch.

#### Analog Effect:

1. Click the **"Toggle Analog"** button to apply or remove the Analog effect.
2. Adjust the **Analog Intensity** slider to control the transparency and strength of the overlay.

#### Trails Effect:

1. Click the **"Toggle Trails"** button to apply or remove the Trails effect.
2. Adjust the **Trails Intensity** slider to control how quickly trails fade.

#### Strobe Effect:

1. Click the **"Start Strobe"** button to begin the Strobe effect. The button text will change to **"Stop Strobe"** when active.
2. Adjust the **Strobe Speed** slider to set the frequency of flashes per second.
3. Use the **Strobe Color** picker to select the color of the strobe flashes.

### Abstract Mode

#### Activate Abstract Mode:

1. Click the **"Start Abstract"** button to begin generating abstract visuals.
2. The button text will change to **"Stop Abstract"** when active.

#### Shape Selection:

1. Choose the type of shapes to generate by clicking on the **"Pixel"**, **"Blob"**, **"Heart"**, or **"Smiley"** buttons.
2. The selected shape will be used for generating abstract visuals.

#### Deactivating Abstract Mode:

- Click the **"Stop Abstract"** button to cease generating abstract visuals.

### Audio Visualization

#### Upload an Audio File:

#### Playback Controls:

1. Use the **"Play"** button to start or pause audio playback.
2. Click the **"Stop"** button to halt playback and reset the audio.

#### Beat Detection:

- As the audio plays, the app analyzes frequency data to detect beats.
- Upon detecting a beat, a random visual effect (Glitch, Analog, Trails, Strobe, or Abstract) is triggered, synchronizing the visuals with the music.

### Video Recording

#### Start Recording:

1. Click the **"Start Recording"** button to begin capturing the canvas with all active effects.

#### Stop Recording:

1. Click the **"Stop Recording"** button to end the recording process.

### Live Visualization

#### Launch Visualization:

1. Click the **"Launch Visualization"** button to open a new window dedicated to live visualization.
2. This window mirrors the effects applied on the main canvas in real-time.

#### Viewing Effects:

- Any effects triggered in the main window will be reflected in the visualization window.
- The strobe effect and abstract visuals are synchronized across both windows.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Buttons Not Responding:

- **Cause:** Event listeners might not be correctly attached, or the corresponding functions are undefined.
- **Solution:** Ensure that all functions referenced by event listeners are properly defined in `app.js`. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.

#### `startRecording` Not Defined:

- **Cause:** The `startRecording` function is being called before it's defined or not defined at all.
- **Solution:** Ensure that the `startRecording` function is correctly implemented in `app.js` and that there are no typos in the function name.

#### PDFs Not Rendering:

- **Cause:** PDF.js library might not be correctly loaded or linked.
- **Solution:** Verify that the PDF.js script is correctly included in `index.html` via the `<script>` tag. Check the browser console for any errors related to PDF rendering.

#### Media Not Displaying Correctly:

- **Cause:** The canvas size might not match the media dimensions, or media files might be corrupted.
- **Solution:** Ensure that the media files are not corrupted and are in supported formats. The canvas automatically resizes to match the media dimensions upon loading.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open the developer console (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`) to view any error messages or logs.

2. **Verify File Paths:**
   - Ensure that `app.js` is correctly linked in `index.html` and that all files are in their respective directories.

3. **Reload the Page:**
   - Sometimes, simply reloading the page can resolve temporary glitches.

4. **Clear Cache:**
   - Clear your browser cache to ensure that the latest versions of your scripts are loaded.

5. **Ensure Compatibility:**
   - Make sure you're using a modern browser that supports all required APIs like `Canvas`, `Web Audio`, `MediaRecorder`, and `BroadcastChannel`.
