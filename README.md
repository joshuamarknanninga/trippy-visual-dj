Installation
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trippy-effects-app.git
Navigate to the Project Directory
bash
Copy code
cd trippy-effects-app
Install Dependencies
The application relies on the PDF.js library, which is included via CDN in the index.html. No additional installations are required. However, ensure you have a local server to run the app.

Run the Application
You can use any local server setup. Here's how to do it using Live Server in VSCode:

Install the Live Server Extension:

Open Visual Studio Code.
Go to the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
Search for "Live Server" and install it.
Open the Project Folder:

Open the trippy-effects-app folder in VSCode.
Start Live Server:

Right-click on index.html in the Explorer panel.
Select "Open with Live Server".
Your default browser should open http://localhost:5500 (port may vary).
Alternatively, using Python's SimpleHTTPServer:

For Python 3.x:
bash
Copy code
python -m http.server
For Python 2.x:
bash
Copy code
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
Usage
Uploading Media
Select File:
Click on the "Choose File" button in the header.
Select a media file from your device. Supported formats include:
Images: JPEG, JPG, GIF
Videos: MP4, WebM, etc.
Audio: MP3, WAV, etc.
PDFs: Any standard PDF document.
Processing:
The app will process the uploaded file and render it onto the canvas.
For PDFs, only the first page is rendered.
Applying Effects
Glitch Effect:
Click the "Toggle Glitch" button to apply or remove the Glitch effect.
Adjust the Glitch Intensity slider to control the severity of the glitch.
Analog Effect:
Click the "Toggle Analog" button to apply or remove the Analog effect.
Adjust the Analog Intensity slider to control the transparency and strength of the overlay.
Trails Effect:
Click the "Toggle Trails" button to apply or remove the Trails effect.
Adjust the Trails Intensity slider to control how quickly trails fade.
Strobe Effect:
Click the "Start Strobe" button to begin the Strobe effect. The button text will change to "Stop Strobe" when active.
Adjust the Strobe Speed slider to set the frequency of flashes per second.
Use the Strobe Color picker to select the color of the strobe flashes.
Abstract Mode
Activate Abstract Mode:
Click the "Start Abstract" button to begin generating abstract visuals.
The button text will change to "Stop Abstract" when active.
Shape Selection:
Choose the type of shapes to generate by clicking on the "Pixel", "Blob", "Heart", or "Smiley" buttons.
The selected shape will be used for generating abstract visuals.
Deactivating Abstract Mode:
Click the "Stop Abstract" button to cease generating abstract visuals.
Audio Visualization
Upload an Audio File:
Upload an audio file using the file input. Supported formats include MP3, WAV, etc.
Playback Controls:
Use the "Play" button to start or pause audio playback.
Click the "Stop" button to halt playback and reset the audio.
Beat Detection:
As the audio plays, the app analyzes frequency data to detect beats.
Upon detecting a beat, a random visual effect (Glitch, Analog, Trails, Strobe, or Abstract) is triggered, synchronizing the visuals with the music.
Video Recording
Start Recording:
Click the "Start Recording" button to begin capturing the canvas with all active effects.
Stop Recording:
Click the "Stop Recording" button to end the recording process.
Once stopped, a "Download Video" link will appear, allowing you to download the recorded WebM video.
Live Visualization
Launch Visualization:
Click the "Launch Visualization" button to open a new window dedicated to live visualization.
This window mirrors the effects applied on the main canvas in real-time.
Viewing Effects:
Any effects triggered in the main window will be reflected in the visualization window.
The strobe effect and abstract visuals are synchronized across both windows.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Buttons Not Responding:
Cause: Event listeners might not be correctly attached, or the corresponding functions are undefined.
Solution: Ensure that all functions referenced by event listeners are properly defined in app.js. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.
startRecording Not Defined:
Cause: The startRecording function is being called before it's defined or not defined at all.
Solution: Ensure that the startRecording function is correctly implemented in app.js and that there are no typos in the function name.
PDFs Not Rendering:
Cause: PDF.js library might not be correctly loaded or linked.
Solution: Verify that the PDF.js script is correctly included in index.html via the <script> tag. Check the browser console for any errors related to PDF rendering.
Media Not Displaying Correctly:
Cause: The canvas size might not match the media dimensions, or media files might be corrupted.
Solution: Ensure that the media files are not corrupted and are in supported formats. The canvas automatically resizes to match the media dimensions upon loading.
Steps to Resolve
Check Browser Console:

Open the developer console (usually by pressing F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I) to view any error messages or logs.
Verify File Paths:

Ensure that app.js is correctly linked in index.html and that all files are in their respective directories.
Reload the Page:

Sometimes, simply reloading the page can resolve temporary glitches.
Clear Cache:

Clear your browser cache to ensure that the latest versions of your scripts are loaded.
Ensure Compatibility:

Make sure you're using a modern browser that supports all required APIs like Canvas, Web Audio, MediaRecorder, and BroadcastChannel.
